As a driven and innovative data science and AI professional, I specialize in bridging cutting-edge technology with real-world business challenges. With a proven track record of spearheading end-to-end machine learning pipelines — from data ingestion and feature engineering to model deployment — I thrive on transforming complex datasets into strategic assets that empower organizations to make informed, future-ready decisions. My expertise spans pioneering advanced solutions in natural language processing, including the development of a DistilBERT-based text summarization system that streamlines information extraction for enterprise clients, as well as designing computer vision algorithms for medical diagnostics, such as my COVID-19 chest X-ray classification model, which demonstrates precision in automating critical healthcare insights.
I excel at architecting scalable AI tools, having engineered a fully automated trading bot powered by the NNFX algorithm to optimize financial decision-making through Python-driven API integrations. My commitment to elevating user experiences extends to full-stack development, exemplified by the creation of Basana Boutique, a responsive e-commerce platform crafted with Django to amplify client revenue streams. Leveraging cloud ecosystems like AWS and Azure, I orchestrate seamless MLOps workflows to deploy models that outperform industry benchmarks, while my fluency in Python, SQL, and PyTorch enables me to pilot predictive analytics initiatives that uncover hidden trends and opportunities.
Beyond technical mastery, I champion data storytelling through dynamic visualizations in Power BI and Tableau, transforming raw metrics into compelling narratives that resonate with stakeholders. Currently advancing my expertise through a Bachelor of Business Information Systems and IBM-certified training, I am laser-focused on harnessing AI to revolutionize fields like healthcare, finance, and sustainable tech — always grounded in ethical innovation and a dedication to delivering solutions that create measurable, lasting impact.
